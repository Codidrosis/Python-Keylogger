# Python-Keylogger

Please note that you should only use a keylogger on your machine, don't use this maliciously 

I'm personally developping this 

1- For fun (because why not) 

2- Running it as a service on my machine to keep track of any thing i did (i have a short memory)

3- Because i wanna keep track of screen shots in mousse clicks, something custom for myself
